# Meetings

Meeting materials for the Private Advertising Technology Working Group.

Meetings are minuted on a shared document and maintain an on-record back-channel held on Slack.

Issues can be opened in this repository to add to meeting agendas. Please use the appropriate label or issue template when you open an issue to mark it as `agenda+`. 

## Structure

The structure of the repo is as follows:

    yyyy/                      ← top level directories are years
